* Rectarrange
This is a crate to pack rectangles orthogonally onto a series of rectangular pages, optimizing for first the number of pages, and then, the most rectangles of rectangles. 
** Motivation
In reality, I am looking for an algorithm that fits arbitrary shapes at arbitrary orientations, and optimizes for similar criteria. The goal is the layout of elements to be cut out on a sheet of paper. 

I have not found an algorithm that solves this problem, so I am starting with the simpler problem to (a) better understand the problem (b) have something that works in the majority of cases.
